# Performance Analysis Report

## 1. Key Performance Metrics Around the Time of Reported Errors
1. **CPU Usage:**
   - Timestamp: `2023-10-01T12:00:00Z`
   - Metrics:
     - Service: `auth-service`, Host: `server-1`, Value: `30.0` percent
     - Service: `product-service`, Host: `server-2`, Value: `35.0` percent

2. **Memory Usage:**
   - Timestamp: `2023-10-01T12:00:00Z`
   - Metrics:
     - Service: `auth-service`, Host: `server-1`, Value: `40.0` percent
     - Service: `product-service`, Host: `server-2`, Value: `45.0` percent
  
3. **Request Duration Metrics:**
   - Timestamp: `2023-10-01T12:15:00Z`
   - Metrics:
     - Service: `checkout-service`, HTTP Method: `POST`, HTTP Status Code: `504`, Value: `30000` ms
  
4. **Error Count Metrics:**
   - Timestamp: `2023-10-01T12:30:45Z`
   - Metrics:
     - Service: `checkout-service`, Error Type: `TimeoutError`, Value: `1`

## 2. Significant Spikes or Anomalies in System Performance
- **CPU Usage Spike:** On `2023-10-01T12:00:00Z`, both `auth-service` and `product-service` show CPU usage of 30% and 35% respectively, which may be a concerning spike depending on historical average usage.
- **High Memory Usage:** At the same timestamp, `auth-service` and `product-service` exhibit 40% and 45% memory usage respectively, which might be indicative of potential inefficiencies or memory leaks.

## 3. Correlation Between Metrics and Known Error Events
- The error count metric indicates a `TimeoutError` occurred at `2023-10-01T12:30:45Z`. 
- The request duration metric for `checkout-service` shows a duration of `30000` ms (30 seconds) with an HTTP 504 status recorded at `2023-10-01T12:15:00Z`, closely correlating with the `TimeoutError`.

## 4. Potential Performance Bottlenecks Identified from the Metrics
- **CPU and Memory Utilization:** High percentages in short intervals suggest CPU and memory bottlenecks which might be causing delays or errors.
- **Request Duration:** The lengthy request duration (30 seconds) contributing to HTTP 504 errors indicates a service delay or inefficient process within `checkout-service`.
- **Error Spike:** The detected `TimeoutError` and lengthy request duration likely indicate a bottleneck in the `checkout-service` during high load or inadequate computing resources.

## Recommendations
- Investigate and optimize CPU and memory usage in `auth-service` and `product-service`.
- Enhance the request handling capacity or performance efficiency of `checkout-service` to reduce request durations.
- Monitor and analyze these metrics continuously to detect and address performance bottlenecks before they lead to critical failures.
