### Detailed Analysis Report:

#### 1. Executive Summary
The analysis revealed key issues of interprocess communication problems, primarily resulting in TimeoutErrors and DataBaseErrors in the system. The `image-server`, `delivery-service1`, and `meal-restaurant-owner` services are significantly affected, as evidenced by performance metrics, trace anomalies, and error logs. Performance degradation during specific operational windows indicates the need for optimizing I/O operations and resource management.

#### 2. Root Cause Analysis:
- **TimeoutErrors** in the `image-server`: High operation durations and observed patterns suggest I/O blocking due to synchronous file system operations.
- **DatabaseErrors** in `delivery-service1`: High CPU utilization could be a result of inefficient database queries or poor indexing strategies.
- **Network Delays** in the `meal-restaurant-owner`: Prolonged TCP connection setup times indicate potential network misconfigurations or resource constraints.

#### 3. Proposed Solutions:
- **Image Server (TimeoutErrors)**
  - Implement non-blocking I/O operations using asynchronous Node.js APIs.
  - Utilize event-driven architecture to prevent blocking the thread.

- **Delivery Service1 (DatabaseErrors)**
  - Optimize database queries, ensure proper indexing, and analyze query execution plans.
  - Consider caching frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

- **Meal Restaurant Owner (Network Delays)**
  - Analyze network latency issues and ensure optimal configuration of network resources.
  - Implement circuit breaker patterns to handle repeated failures gracefully.

#### 4. Detailed Error Analysis:
- **TimeoutError Handling**
  - Implement server-side timeouts for incoming HTTP requests to prevent indefinite waiting.
  - Use client-side timeouts for outgoing requests and apply retry logic with exponential backoff when feasible.

#### 5. Performance Optimization Recommendations:
- Ensure non-blocking I/O patterns in Node.js to enhance performance.
- Apply strategic timeout values determined from realistic load testing.
- Implement health checks and use observability tools for real-time performance monitoring.
