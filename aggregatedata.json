  "SystemOverview": "Suboptimal performance with occasional bottlenecks. The system demonstrates low CPU utilization, suggesting underuse of computational resources. However, external service dependencies and database connectivity issues are major detractors from performance.",
  "KeyPerformanceMetrics": "Metric at UnixTimeA: process.cpu.utilization = 7.62e-07, Metric at UnixTimeB: process.cpu.utilization = 1.76e-04.",
  "CriticalErrors": "1. TimeoutError in checkout-service at TraceTimeC: Timeout occurred in HTTP call to payment-service. 2. DatabaseError in product-service at TraceTimeD: Connection refused in database query.",
  "PerformanceAnomalies": "1. Product-Service: Occasional long response times with some connection errors. 2. Payment-Service: Timeouts in payment gateway interactions.",
  "ServiceAnalysis": "product-service: Issues with database connection errors and abnormal span delays. Metrics indicate average latency of 90 ms (normal) to 350 ms (with error). checkout-service: Issues include TimeoutError with payment-service and external service dependencies; 3 timeouts in span of trace. payment-service: Dependency on external gateway and repeated timeouts; significant latency increase when external calls involved.",
  "TraceHighlights": "1. Trace HTTP POST /api/v1/payment in payment-gateway: TimeoutError causing delays. 2. Trace /api/v1/products in product-service: DatabaseError impacting response.",
  "CorrelatedEvents": "Low CPU utilization correlated with TimeoutError; external dependencies likely bottlenecks, not CPU.",
  "PotentialRootCauses": "1. TimeoutError in checkout-service due to possible network bottleneck with payment gateway. 2. DatabaseError in product-service due to possible database server connectivity problem.",
  "RecommendedActions": "1. Investigate network path between services and external dependencies. 2. Review and optimize database connection management. 3. Implement redundant external service paths to mitigate single points of failure.",
  "QueryTerms": "TimeoutError checkout-service, DatabaseError product-service, process.cpu.utilization spikes, external service bottleneck"
