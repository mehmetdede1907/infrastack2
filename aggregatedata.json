  "SystemOverview": "The system is experiencing notable performance bottlenecks and errors primarily related to the 'payment-service' and 'meal-order' services. Timeout and DNS resolution issues are prevalent, affecting overall reliability.",
  "KeyPerformanceMetrics": "Timestamp: 2023-10-01T12:50:25Z, Service: payment-service, Metric: HTTP 504 Status, Value: 1, Description: Timeout error recorded; Service: product-service, Metric: Database Connection Error, Instance: products_db, Details: Concurrent with payment-service timeout; Metric: Request Duration, Endpoint: /delivery-price, Duration: 14503301μs, Description: Excessive request duration time identified.",
  "CriticalErrors": "Type: TimeoutError, Service: payment-service, Timestamp: 2023-10-01T12:50:25Z, Message: HTTP 504 gateway timeout; Type: DNSError, Service: meal-order, Operation: dns.lookup, Details: DNS resolution failure.",
  "PerformanceAnomalies": "Type: Prolonged Request Duration, Service: payment-service, Impact: Increased likelihood of timeouts; Behavior: Slow I/O Operations, Service: meal-restaurant-owner, Function: fs.existsSync, Duration: 62200μs.",
  "ServiceAnalysis": "payment-service: PerformanceIssues: Frequent Gateway Timeout Errors, High Request Duration; meal-order: Errors: DNS Lookup Failures; image-server: I/O Latency: Observed in filesystem checks; meal-restaurant-owner: Performance: Repeated slow file system operation spans.",
  "TraceHighlights": "Service: meal-order, Span: dns.lookup, Status: Error, Issue: DNS Resolution Delay; Service: meal-restaurant-owner, Span: fs.existsSync, Duration: 62.2ms, Observation: Detected file system interaction slowdown.",
  "CorrelatedEvents": "Error: HTTP 504, RequestDuration: 14.5s on /delivery-price, ServiceImpacted: payment-service; Error: DNSError, SlowSpan: dns.lookup, ServiceImpacted: meal-order.",
  "PotentialRootCauses": "Hypothesis: High request processing time leading to timeouts in payment-service; Hypothesis: DNS configuration or network instability causing meal-order service failures; Hypothesis: Underlying filesystem or hardware constraints affecting I/O operations.",
  "RecommendedActions": "Investigate and optimize the payment-service request handling and timeout settings; Review DNS configurations and improve caching strategies for the meal-order service; Analyze underlying storage system performance for potential hardware upgrades or configurations.",
  "QueryTerms": "TimeoutError payment-service; DNS lookup failure meal-order; Prolonged request duration; Filesystem I/O bottleneck"
